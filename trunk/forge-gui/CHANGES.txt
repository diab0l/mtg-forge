Release Notes
-------------

- Updated Forge Content Downloads -
Card images for the latest sets are now available for download, including 
Tempest Remastered and Modern Masters 2015. All images have also been moved to a
 new server for increased reliability and performance and many previously 
missing images have been added. There are still a few images missing in Forge 
and rectifying that is an ongoing effort.


- Morph/Manifest images -
Forge now supports proper images for face-down creatures. In order to correctly
use these images, it's necessary to remove a file in your picture directory
(see below), then redownload token images. Alternatively, you can do this
yourself by renaming the current file "morph.jpg" to "hidden.jpg" and adding
new files "morph.jpg" and "manifest.jpg" for the morph and manifest reminder
overlays, respectively. All these files are located inside the "tokens"
subdirectory of your image cache, which can be found here:
- Windows: [home directory]/Application Data/Forge/Cache/pics
- Mac:     [home directory]/Library/Caches/Forge/pics
- Linux:   [home directory]/.cache/forge/pics


- Interface Update -
The interface has received several small changes.
- The "Players" panel has been removed. This information can now be viewed by
  hovering the cursor over a player's avatar.
- The poison counters value has been moved to next to a players life total.
  This is only visible if the player has any poison counters.
- The poison counters button has been replaced with a Command Zone button.
  The command zone panels have been removed.


- Display Color Identity -
There's a new option "Display Color Identity" in both desktop and mobile Forge 
that allows you to display the current color identity of cards. It's disabled
by default (set to "Never") but can be toggled to "Always" (which displays color
identity for all cards, even mono-color), to "Changed" (which displays color
identity of all cards whose color identity has been altered compared to its 
"pristine" state), to "Multicolor" (which only displays color identity of cards 
that are currently of two or more colors) or to "Multi+Changed" (which displays
color identity of all multicolor cards and also of all cards the identity of
which has changed). This might help with effects such as Painter's Servant which
add colors to cards and which make most cards display with the gold border. The
option is currently found under "Graphic Options" for both versions of Forge.

Starting with v1.6.0 this option has been renamed to "Show Detailed Card Color"
in order to avoid confusion (because card identity is a Magic: the Gathering
term that is not equivalent to the sum of card colors).


- New Quest Preferences -
Three new quest preferences (Playset Size: Basic Lands, Playset Size: Any 
Number, and Playset Size) have been added to control the number of cards to keep
 before selling extras in quest mode. One is for basic lands, one is for 
"unlimited" cards (Relentless Rats and Shadowborn Apostle), and the last one is 
for all other cards. This is mostly useful when playing for antes and you want 
to keep an extra couple of cards on hand, just in case, or if you want to keep 
fewer copies of basic lands around.


- Display tokens on the same row as other cards / on their own row -
By default the game now displays tokens on the same row as non-token cards (and
to the right of them), which makes the game use the battlefield space more
effectively. For example, creature tokens are displayed to the right of regular
non-token creatures in the same row. If you prefer the classic Forge behavior
(when tokens are displayed on their own row), the option that controls this 
behavior can be found in Forge preferences under "Graphic Options". It is called
"Display Tokens in a Separate Row".


- Network play (BETA) -
This version of Forge includes a preliminary version of peer-to-peer (P2P)
network support. If one player hosts, other players can connect to that
player's machine by filling out the corresponding IP address and port number
(default 36743), provided the lobby contains one or more open player slots.
Do not expect network support to work reliably yet, any bug reports or other
comments are welcome!


- Smarter Deck Color Determination -
When determining the color of decks, colors of hybrid and phyrexian cards are no
longer considered unless they can be produced by a land in the deck


- Land Color Filtering in Deck Editor -
When filtering colors in the Deck Editor, lands that produce all selected colors will now be shown
This means if you filter to show only green and white cards, lands that produce green and white will now be shown
This should hopefully make finding multicolor lands for your decks easier.
An attempt was made to make this option behave in a more consistent and helpful way - now lands won't suddenly 
disappear when one color is filtered out, basic lands of appropriate colors will be shown, lands that feature at 
least one of the colors relevant for the deck will be shown. Also, the mode to filter lands in this way is now 
optional and can be toggled on or off in the Preferences ("Filter Lands by Color in Activated Abilities" under
"Deck Editor Options").


- Quest Starting Pool Configuration -
When starting a new quest, you now have many more options to configure your starting pool. Instead of just picking a
single color, you can pick any combination of them, including colorless. There's also the option to include artifacts in
the pool alongside your colored cards or not.
The "color bias" option in the quest settings is now the percentage of your generated card pool that will contain the
settings you've selected. For example, if you picked Green cards and a color bias of 75, your card pool would be 75%
green, 25% all other colors.

Finally, there's three settings to choose your color distribution. "Balanced" maintains an equal balance between your
selected colors. "Random" completely randomizes the pool and makes only miniscule attempts to control the cards you get.
"Surprise Me" is much like "Balanced", except it will pick all your settings for you and not tell you what they were!
The New/Load quest menu has been given a small facelift to accommodate these changes and make it easier to read.
You will need to update your color bias quest setting as the values are now much too low.

Known Issues
------------

- Dragon Presence cards from DTK -
Work has started on the Dragon Presence cards. These cards should typically work on their own merits, but a few corner cases dealing with copying/cloning may not work as expected. As these cases are fairly limited, it was decided to add these cards for people to be able to use. 

- Dragons of Tarkir -
Forge now includes many of the new Dragons of Tarkir cards. It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

- Fate Reforged cards -
Forge now includes many of the new Fate Reforged cards. It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

- Commander 2014 cards -
Forge now includes many of the new Commander 2014 cards. It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

- New Khans of Tarkir cards -
Forge now includes many of the new Khans of Tarkir cards. It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

- Continued Work on Conspiracy -
Conspiracy is one of the strangest sets that have been released in some time. Currently, we have a few of the "Draft matters" cards scripted, although you'll find that they won't quite be available to you (unless you add them manually into a draft deck). Hopefully we'll get the appropriate functionality in so we can start including them in boosters and allowing you to add Conspiracy type cards straight to your deck the way you do every other variant card. We'll make sure to point out when all of these kinks have worked themselves out.

- The Mac OS application version -
We can now package Forge as a Mac OS application. You can double click the Forge.app icon to launch the forge application on your Apple computer running Mac OS. This application will automatically increase the java heap space memory for you as it launches. This version does not require the forge.command file and it does not need to start the Terminal application as part of the start up process.

The Mac OS X app version apparently requires the Mavericks OS and is not compatible with earlier OS X versions. People with earlier OS X versions should use the Windows and Linux version and launch forge on their Mac by double clicking on the included "forge.command" file.

- Magic 2015 cards -
It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

- Conspiracy cards -

The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

- Commander 2013 cards -
It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

- Born of the Gods cards -
It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

There is a known issue with Kodama of the Center Tree: its Soulshift X ability used to crash Forge, and until a proper fix can be implemented, a temporary fix was introduced which prevents the crash but makes the Soulshift X ability work incorrectly in certain cases (in particular, it doesn't work correctly with mass removal, and it may have issues when Kodama of the Center Tree is controlled by someone else other than its owner). In the basic cases (such as Kodama of the Center Tree being destroyed in combat or with a direct damage spell) should work correctly. Hopefully one of the developers will be able to implement a better and proper fix for this card soon.

There is a known issue with the cost reduction for cards that have color-locked X in their mana cost (e.g. Drain Life, Soul Burn). Cost reduction will not apply correctly to these cards if the amount by which the cost is reduced is greater than the amount of colorless mana in the mana cost specified on the card (e.g. 1 for Drain Life, 2 for Soul Burn). Fixing this issue likely requires rewriting the way announced color-locked X is interpreted and paid (most likely it has to be represented with colorless mana shards but still locked to the colors required by the card).

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with each other. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there is one remaining issue that we hope will be addressed in the near future:
Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
