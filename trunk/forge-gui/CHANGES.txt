Release Notes
-------------

- Improved dialog appearance -
Many message and confirmation dialogs now use skinned look with rounded border dialog on top of overlay.


- Deck Editor usability improvements -
You can now mark a card as a favorite in the Catalog by clicking the star icon in the first column. This will default the card to sort ahead of non-favorite cards if you sort on that first column (which is now the Forge default).
You can now add or remove cards from a deck using +/- buttons that appear on either side of the quantity for each card.
Filters are now available on Current Deck pane, replacing the need for the static stat labels.
A new filter has been added to allow filtering on specific Converted Mana Costs (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6+), as well as displaying the card count at each CMC.
Color and Type filter buttons no longer wrap, instead growing or shrinking as needed (along with the font the count string is too long).
Color and Type filter buttons can now be hidden, as well as be added from the Filters menu (formally "Add filter").
The Total stat label has been removed in favor of showing a caption and (# SHOWN/# AVAILBLE) ratio above the table. The caption is "Catalog" for the Catalog pane, and the deck name for the "Current Deck" pane.
Checkboxes are now available for each filter type, allowing that filter to be disabled and re-enabled without losing the configuration of that filter (such as chosen sets).
Adding a filter for formats, sets, and quest worlds now merges into existing filters of that type if possible to apply OR logic, rather than both appearing as separate filters with AND logic applied, likely resulting in no results.
Pressing Ctrl+Enter to add a filter for the current search now adds another editable search bar rather than just a label.
Cards added to deck are now selected, even if multiple are added at once. The performance of adding and removing multiple cards at once has also been improved.
When some but not all copies of a selected card are removed from the deck, that card now remains selected in the case of multiple cards being selected.


- Constructed mode -
Recently a change was made to the constructed mode and this change now allows you to have up to 8 players rather than just two. The game formats that are located in the variants mode also allow up to eight players. The current user interface for this feature is fairly basic and is not very attractive. The settings tab allows you to set the number of opponents. The player tabs includes the same options that you used to see in the constructed mode.

Marc recently sketched out a couple of attractive mockups that look far more attractive than what we are now using. We just need someone with java skills and swing experience to modify the existing code.

- Commander 2013 cards -
Forge now includes many of the new Commander 2013 cards. It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

Known Issues
------------

There is a known issue with the timing of Leaves the Battlefield triggers and multiple permanents Leaving the Battlefield. As an example, when Blood Artist died at the same time as a lot of other creatures due to a Wrath of God, the Blood Artist should trigger for every creature but does not do so.

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with each other. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there is one remaining issue that we hope will be addressed in the near future:
Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
