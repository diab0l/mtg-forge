Release Notes
-------------

- New Commander 2014 and Khans of Tarkir cards -
We have added a branch to our SVN for the new cards that are currently being scripted. These cards are not yet available in this build of forge. Please be patient and they will soon become available.


- There will not be a 1.5.27 beta version -
We will not be releasing a 1.5.27 beta version and the next beta version will be numbered 1.5.28. Beta 1.5.27 was an internal test version in an effort on our part to improve the build and deploy process.


- Quest Draft Improvements -
Quest drafts have been updated to be more valuable to your quest! 
Bug fixes: Drafts now correctly rotate based on wins and quest preferences. Booster pack prices are now correctly calculated when presenting awards. No more 500+ alpha booster packs. Sorry! Other misc. fixes as well.
Now, when you place first or second, you will get to pick a rare in the drafted block's pool to keep. This is in addition to the already existing prizes.
Additionally, when you spend draft tokens, you no longer receive a random draft. Instead, you get to pick which block the new draft will be (but you still have to pay for it!), completely eliminating the game of chance.

Known Issues
------------

- Continued Work on Conspiracy -
Conspiracy is one of the strangest sets that have been released in some time. Currently, we have a few of the "Draft matters" cards scripted, although you'll find that they won't quite be available to you (unless you add them manually into a draft deck). Hopefully we'll get the appropriate functionality in so we can start including them in boosters and allowing you to add Conspiracy type cards straight to your deck the way you do every other variant card. We'll make sure to point out when all of these kinks have worked themselves out.

- The Mac OS application version -
We can now package Forge as a Mac OS application. You can double click the Forge.app icon to launch the forge application on your Apple computer running Mac OS. This application will automatically increase the java heap space memory for you as it launches. This version does not require the forge.command file and it does not need to start the Terminal application as part of the start up process.

The Mac OS X app version apparently requires the Mavericks OS and is not compatible with earlier OS X versions. People with earlier OS X versions should use the Windows and Linux version and launch forge on their Mac by double clicking on the included "forge.command" file.

- Magic 2015 cards -
It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

- Conspiracy cards -
Forge now includes many of the new Conspiracy cards. It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

- Commander 2013 cards -
It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient.

- Born of the Gods cards -
It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient.

There is a known issue with the cost reduction for cards that have color-locked X in their mana cost (e.g. Drain Life, Soul Burn). Cost reduction will not apply correctly to these cards if the amount by which the cost is reduced is greater than the amount of colorless mana in the mana cost specified on the card (e.g. 1 for Drain Life, 2 for Soul Burn). Fixing this issue likely requires rewriting the way announced color-locked X is interpreted and paid (most likely it has to be represented with colorless mana shards but still locked to the colors required by the card).

There is a known issue with the timing of Leaves the Battlefield triggers and multiple permanents Leaving the Battlefield. As an example, when Blood Artist died at the same time as a lot of other creatures due to a Wrath of God, the Blood Artist should trigger for every creature but does not do so.

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with each other. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there is one remaining issue that we hope will be addressed in the near future:
Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
