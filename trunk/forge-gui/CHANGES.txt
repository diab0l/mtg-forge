Release Notes
-------------

- The Mac OS application version -

We can now package Forge as a Mac OS application. You can double click the Forge.app icon to launch the forge application on your Apple computer running Mac OS. This application will automatically increase the java heap space memory for you as it launches. This version does not require the forge.command file and it does not need to start the Terminal application as part of the start up process.


- New ItemManager Preferences -
The editor.preferences file has been deprecated, and the Preferences pane of Deck Editor screens has been removed. Instead, each CardManager and DeckManager (in deck editors, game launch screens, and deck viewer) can have its own options configured individually on its View Options panel.

To show/hide columns, simply go to the List View of any CardManager or DeckManager and click the View Options button (to the right of the Image View toggle button). This will show a panel containing checkboxes for each column, along with a "Unique Cards Only" checkbox on the Constructed Deck Editor Catalog. Your choices will be remembered between sessions, as will any column sorting, repositioning, and resizing. You can toggle the View Options button again to hide this panel.

For Image View, this options panel is visible by default and contains a button to expand/collapse all groups along with combo boxes to configure the "Group By", "Pile By", "Columns" properties that are also saved between sessions. Note that even if this panel is hidden, Ctrl+MouseWheel can be used to adjust the "Columns" property to essentially zoom in and out.


- Variant game modes -
All variants can now be applied via the constructed match setup. While moving Commander across, a basic experimental Commander deck generator was implemented. It will select a random two-color identity commander, and use those colors to build a two-color singleton deck. It is at least a starting point if someone doesn't have any Commander decks and doesn't want to or doesn't have time to build one.


- Quest Mode Pet Balancing -
Two quest mode pets have had their power reduced to reflect their strength relative to the rest of the other pets. The white Wolf Pet now has Lifelink instead of Vigilance, and the blue Bird Pet now scries for 1 instead of loots for 1 on combat damage. This change is immediate, so make sure to download Quest Images to get the new pictures.

- Commander 2013 cards -
It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

There is a known issue with the timing of Leaves the Battlefield triggers and multiple permanents Leaving the Battlefield. As an example, when Blood Artist died at the same time as a lot of other creatures due to a Wrath of God, the Blood Artist should trigger for every creature but does not do so.

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with each other. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there is one remaining issue that we hope will be addressed in the near future:
Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
