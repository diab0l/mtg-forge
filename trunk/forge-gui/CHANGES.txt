Release Notes
-------------

- Select abilities using context menu -
Instead of displaying a dialog to select abilities, you'll now get a context menu when left or right clicking cards with multiple ability choices.
Each ability will have a keyboard shortcut of 1-9 based on order.
Unplayable activated abilities will still appear disabled so shortcuts are constant regardless of game state.


- Mana symbols shown in Card Detail and ability menu -
The Card Detail pane now shows mana symbols in place of WUBRG and other appropriate text characters.
Same for ability context menu described above and Game Prompt pane.
Also fixed WUBRG of colored mana symbols on a few dozen cards.
Reminder text now appears in italics, with a preference that can be set to hide it.


- Quest mode bazaar -
Added a new Quest Item, Charm of Vigor. Let's you play best of 5 games rather than best of 3.


- Commander 2013 cards -
Forge now includes many of the new Commander 2013 cards. It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

Known Issues
------------

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with each other. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there is one remaining issue that we hope will be addressed in the near future:
Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
