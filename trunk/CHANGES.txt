Forge Beta: 10-26-2012 ver 1.3.0

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)

11492 cards in total.


Some large scale changes are being made to the code at this time and this portion of the project is not yet finished. The Forge snapshot builds should be considered unstable. Most people will want to play the last beta rather then help test the new snapshot builds for the next seveal weeks.

--

The new damage dialog now uses the new UI.

We have decided to increase the version number to 1.3 as there were some substantial changes and improvements made in recent weeks. In the recent past we had some improvements made to the draft, sealed deck and quest modes.

This version includes quest mode sets unlocks, an 'enforced format quest', and custom formats. A new Gauntlet mode has been added. A new multiplayer mode has also been added. You should be able to play against multiple AI opponents at this time. You should note that the current Archenemy mode does not use Schemes at this time.

A lot of things are planned for this new multiplayer mode and it will take time to finish. Please enjoy what we have at this time and be patient. :)

Since Multiplayer is so new, not all cards will be 100% compatible right away as we expand scripting to handle multiple players.

The older match layout files are incompatible with the new multiplayer mode. The original match_default.xml, match_preferred.xml and the match_preferred.xml saved to a different name files have to go and can no longer be used. You can keep your editor_preferred.xml file. But you will have to setup your match view panels using the new match_default.xml file.

Some people reported that the new targeting arcs are not being redrawn when the target moves to another area. This is a work in progress and we hope to fix it at some point in the future. If this happens, you should try turning the targeting arcs to off and then back on again.

Several people have asked if it is still possible to resize (change the width) of the columns in the deck editors. In version 1.2.15 the mouse cursor would not change. This has been fixed in later versions.

--

On several occasions people have noticed that the forge deck editor and/or quest mode card shop would not open or display. We have also received reports that some of the tabs/panels in the deck editor are missing. Try deleting the file named "editor_preferred.xml" which is found in the "res/layouts" folder. This should force forge to then use the "editor_default.xml" file instead.

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with eachother. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

It seems like the front face of double faced cards aren't triggering properly, but the back face and single faced cards are.

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there are two remaining issues that we hope will be addressed in the near future.

1. Leave play triggers don't work correct for clones.
2. Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

We are now using a different system for our snapshot and beta releases. Unfortunately, this new system builds a jar file which does not accurately display the SVN revision number.

Forge may not be fully java 7 compatible at this time. We recommend that people downgrade to java 6.

--

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
