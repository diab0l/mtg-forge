Forge Beta: 0#-##-2012 ver 1.2.8

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)

10### cards in total.


The deck editors now use the new UI. The new deck editors include:

* a better text search (can search for multiple terms, and "not" terms
* interval filters for P/T and CMC
* add/remove 4
* better statistics and draw probabilities
* Toggle-able, sort-able, resize-able, move-able columns
* and of course uses the drag cell layout.

With the update to the new deck editors several people have noticed an error when they run the snapshot build. We hope to have this fixed in the near future. This start up error states:

Detailed error trace:
java.lang.NullPointerException
at forge.gui.deckeditor.controllers.CEditorPreferences.initialize(CEditorPreferences.java:45)
at forge.view.FView.initialize(FView.java:97)


The res/images/icons/ folder has been moved to res/pics/icons/. This folder holds the quest opponent icons, bazaar pets, and bazaar plants. If you have downloaded this content, it will still work, but the folder must be moved on your computer.


Some people have noticed special quests do not have the start in play cards appearing. And some people have noticed that a match can start without any cards appearing in the players hands or in their libraries.

A possible fix was submitted to the SVN for forge version 1.2.7. We have received several reports that the above bugs are still occuring. We hope to have this problem fixed at some point in the future.

The dock now has a new button labeled "Open Layout" along with old button with original function "Revert Layout". Modifying the battlefield layout will result in your changes being saved to a file named  "match_preferred.xml". You can copy and rename that file to share your layouts with other people.


The hard drive which was used for the Maven based build and release system has become unstable and can no longer be used for this purpose.

We are now using a different system for our snapshot and beta releases and this system uses an up to date OS. Unfortunately, this new system builds a jar file which does not accurately display the SVN revision number.

We apologize for this inconvenience.


The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove usefull. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

We have changed the archival format used for the Forge distributions from ".zip" to ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
