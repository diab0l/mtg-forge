Forge Beta: 12-14-2012 ver 1.3.3

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)
(Thanks to the MAGE team for permission to use their targeting arrows.)
(Thanks to http://www.freesound.org/browse/ for providing some sound files.)

11674 cards in total.


The Alara Reborn set is now 100% implemented.

Schemes have been added to the Archenemy mode. This is a work in progress and there may be a bug or two for us to find. Please discuss this new feature in the 1.3.3 beta release topic.


This version of forge includes a few sound files for the new sound effect system. While we have several sounds assigned to a few of the available events there are a number of events that do not yet have a assigned sound file. This should be considered a work in progress and we could use some help in finding interesting sounds that we can add to forge.

The sound files need to be in wav or au format, wav appears to be more wide spread but the code can handle either format. The sound files need to be copy right free and they should be in the public domain.

You can either record your own sounds if you have the necessary equipment or you may be able to find an appropriate sound on a web site such as this site:

http://www.freesound.org/browse/

You should note that sound files can be large sized and we would like to avoid this if possible. A good size to shoot for would be 50 K or less. There is a freeware sound editor that may have versions for all operating systems. This app is named Audacity.

We have a forge forum topic at the Collectible Card Games Headquarters web site that is devoted to finding sounds for this new sound system. Please visit this topic and contribute a sound or two. We can use your help and assistance. :)

On several occasions people have noticed that the forge deck editor and/or quest mode card shop would not open or display. We have also received reports that some of the tabs/panels in the deck editor are missing. Try deleting the file named "editor_preferred.xml" which is found in the "res/layouts" folder. This should force forge to then use the "editor_default.xml" file instead.

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with eachother. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

It seems like the front face of double faced cards aren't triggering properly, but the back face and single faced cards are.

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there are two remaining issues that we hope will be addressed in the near future.

1. Leave play triggers don't work correct for clones.
2. Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

We are now using a different system for our snapshot and beta releases. Unfortunately, this new system builds a jar file which does not accurately display the SVN revision number.

Forge is likely to be compatible with Java 7 at this time. Some people have used forge with Java 7 and have not reported any problems that are related to Java 7. If you would like to upgrade to Java 7 and have held off because of Forge then you may upgrade as we do not think that it will cause an incompatibility type of problem at this time. We will continue to try to maintain compatibility with Java 6 for the foreseeable future.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
