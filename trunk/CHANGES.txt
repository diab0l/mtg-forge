(Thanks to the MAGE team for permission to use their targeting arrows.)
(Thanks to http://www.freesound.org/browse/ for providing some sound files.)

11### cards in total.

This version of forge includes a few sound files for the new sound effect system. While we have several sounds assigned to a few of the available events there are a number of events that do not yet have a assigned sound file. This should be considered a work in progress and we could use some help in finding interesting sounds that we can add to forge.

The sound files need to be in wav or au format, wav appears to be more wide spread but the code can handle either format. The sound files need to be copy right free and they should be in the public domain.

You can either record your own sounds if you have the necessary equipment or you may be able to find an appropriate sound on a web site such as this site:

http://www.freesound.org/browse/

You should note that sound files can be large sized and we would like to avoid this if possible. A good size to shoot for would be 50 K or less. There is a freeware sound editor that may have versions for all operating systems. This app is named Audacity.

We have a forge forum topic at the Collectible Card Games Headquarters web site that is devoted to finding sounds for this new sound system. Please visit this topic and contribute a sound or two. We can use your help and assistance. :)

On several occasions people have noticed that the forge deck editor and/or quest mode card shop would not open or display. We have also received reports that some of the tabs/panels in the deck editor are missing. Try deleting the file named "editor_preferred.xml" which is found in the "res/layouts" folder. This should force forge to then use the "editor_default.xml" file instead.

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with eachother. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

It seems like the front face of double faced cards aren't triggering properly, but the back face and single faced cards are.

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there are two remaining issues that we hope will be addressed in the near future.

1. Leave play triggers don't work correct for clones.
2. Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

We are now using a different system for our snapshot and beta releases. Unfortunately, this new system builds a jar file which does not accurately display the SVN revision number.

Forge is likely to be compatible with Java 7 at this time. Some people have used forge with Java 7 and have not reported any problems that are related to Java 7. If you would like to upgrade to Java 7 and have held off because of Forge then you may upgrade as we do not think that it will cause an incompatibility type of problem at this time. We will continue to try to maintain compatibility with Java 6 for the foreseeable future.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.


Fixes/Features:

- Sideboarding: Initial commit. Added full sideboard support with the ability to create sideboards for Constructed and Quest decks, as well as use sideboard in Limited modes; full deck validation depending on the game format; ingame sideboarding that is persistent across the duels of one match. *No AI support yet, hopefully someone will be able to add it in the future*
- Converted Winds of Change to use RepeatEach so moomarc can use it as an example
- Display X costs in the deck editor before Colorless Mana (X 1 B instead of 1 X B)
- Fixed and polished AI using ETB Counterspells (like Mystic Snake).
- The sideboard is now available as a zone.
- Added a few missing SetInfos.
- Preparing the changes.txt file for the next beta build and release.
- Sideboarding: fixed the sideboard becoming fubar after playing at least one quest match.
- Sideboarding: minor TODO comment update.
- Fixed Quest for the Holy Relic.
- Added the recent commit logs to changes.txt. Preparing for the snapshot build release.
- Added a way to discard any number of cards via a two-panel interface to the AF Discard.
- Added the keyword "If CARDNAME would be destroyed, regenerate it.".
- Corrected the rarity of Last Rites.
- Sideboarding: the drafting window will no longer show an option to switch between the main and the sideboard (only the drafted deck editor will).
- The game will no longer complain about the RemAIDeck cards that are located in the AI sideboard (otherwise it polluted limited mode with a list of all cards that the AI drafted but did not put into its deck as if they were put into the deck).
- A more appropriate measure for the AI complaints about non-AI friendly cards in sideboard: in Limited modes, the AI will currently not complain (because the non-AI friendly cards end up in the sideboard anyway), but in Constructed modes, the AI will complain if any unplayable cards are included in the sideboard.
- Fixed Demonic Hordes.
- Sideboarding: Fixed the interaction of sideboarding with flip cards which caused a crash if the card was flipped at the end of the game.
- Sideboarding: Attempt at fixing interaction of sideboarding with the mulligan in rounds 2 and 3 (experimental, might not actually do the trick).
- Fixed Jerrard of the Closed Fist.
- Fixing Sleight of Hand in Quest mode not allowing a free mulligan
- Sideboarding: Temporarily disabled main/sideboard persistence across duels in a match because the current implementation results in many difficult to fix bugs. Will hopefully reimplement this soon in another way.
- Sideboarding: removed the old deck persistence system. Hopefully a new implementation will follow soon enough (as soon as I understand how it can be done or someone volunteers to help).
- Sideboarding: during deck validation between the duels in a match, the deck will be considered valid if it's no less than either the format-enforced minimum or the minimum after the previous duel in a match (to account for the possibility of losing a card on ante).
- Sideboarding: you can now put any number of snow-covered basic lands into your deck, per MTG rules.
- A little correction to the previous commit.
- Evoke is now flagged as non-basic cost.
- Sideboarding: Attempt two at in-match deck configuration persistence. Currently still not 100% functional (Constructed and Limited seem to work fine, no cards disappearing between matches bugs and persistence works; in Quest, persistence also works but it lasts longer than the match). Ante seems to work correctly, at least in Quest mode.
- Added the recent commit logs to changes.txt. Preparing for the snapshot build release.
