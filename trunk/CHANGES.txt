Forge Beta: 03-01-2013 ver 1.3.9


12193 cards in total.


Release Notes:

You can now cast cards for it's miracle cost without getting a crash. Blocking with a creature was not resetting after combat and this would prevent this creature from blocking in subsequent turns, now fixed.

Work continues on the quest worlds format and a new world based on Ravnica is coming along nicely.

Added a 'copy to clipboard' button on WinLose screen so players can easily copy the game log.

Find-as-you-type is now implemented for Deck Editor tables.  Just start typing while the table has focus and the next card with a matching string in its name will be highlighted.  If more than one card matches, hit Enter to select the next matching card.  A popup panel will appear with the search string so you know what you are searching for.  If no cards match the string, the string will be highlighted in red.  Normally, if you hit the spacebar while a card is selected in one table, the card will be moved to the other table (catalog/deck).  When the popup is displayed, space characters are interpreted as part of the search string.  Find-as-you-type mode is automatically exited after 5 seconds of inactivity, or hit Escape to exit find-as-you-type mode immediately.

The Deck Editor has also gained some hotkey and context menu abilities.  R-click on a card (or a group of selected cards) for a list of actions and keyboard shortcuts.  In particular, you can now transfer cards 4 at a time using the keyboard and interact with the sideboard from anywhere.  Also remember that you can jump to the other table with the arrow keys and jump to the text filter with ctrl/cmd+f.  From the text filter, you can jump down to the tables by pressing enter.

In recent weeks people had noticed that the computer was picking the weakest cards in Draft mode rather than the strongest cards. This left the AI with a draft mode deck that was suboptimal. The computer should now pick the strongest cards rather than the weakest cards.

Work was also done on making the UI more keyboard-friendly.  For example, the OK button should now stay focused during matches, so you can advance through the stages by hitting Enter without having to go over and click the button all the time.  If you find the button is losing focus, please report it as a bug.

Gatecrash Guild Sealed game mode has been added. To use it, start a new Sealed Mode Game, select "Block / Set" and "Gatecrash Guild Sealed". Select the first (default) configuration in the "Choose Set Combination" dialog, and when asked to pick your boosters, choose the guild you want twice (once for the guild-specific booster, and then for the extra promo cards). 
The following cards are not included in the guild boosters of this game mode because they are not currently implemented in Forge: Bane Alley Broker, Bioshift, Killing Glare, Simic Manipulator.

All Traditional sets are now up to 85% complete. Standard Format is supported at 99.19%. We are now at under 800 unsupported cards that are missing from Forge.

A person reported "Love the game but I seem to be having a problem using a draft pool to start a quest. It works for sealed for me but when I select the draft deck option it's always blank even if I have one or several drafts completed." This should now be fixed and draft decks should now show up in quest start combobox.

Several of the exiting sound files were changed and a handful of new sounds were added to the /res/sound/ folder.

Our snapshot and beta releases should now display the correct SVN revision number in the title bar. This should allow people to file a bug report with the correct SVN revision number.

Known Issues:

On several occasions people have noticed that the forge deck editor and/or quest mode card shop would not open or display. We have also received reports that some of the tabs/panels in the deck editor are missing. Try deleting the file named "editor_preferred.xml" which is found in the "res/layouts" folder. This should force forge to then use the "editor_default.xml" file instead.

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with each other. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

It seems like the front face of double faced cards aren't triggering properly, but the back face and single faced cards are.

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there are two remaining issues that we hope will be addressed in the near future.

1. Leave play triggers don't work correct for clones.
2. Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

Forge is likely to be compatible with Java 7 at this time. Some people have used forge with Java 7 and have not reported any problems that are related to Java 7. If you would like to upgrade to Java 7 and have held off because of Forge then you may upgrade as we do not think that it will cause an incompatibility type of problem. We will continue to try to maintain compatibility with Java 6 for the foreseeable future.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
