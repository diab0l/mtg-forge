Forge Beta: 0#-##-2012 ver 1.2.# rev 13###

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)

#### cards in total.


The thread safety issue should now be fixed. This should prevent the crash reports that were stating that "Buffers have not been created".


The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove usefull. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

We have changed the archival format used for the Forge distributions from ".zip" to ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.
