Forge Beta: ##-##-2012 ver 1.2.# rev #####

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)

#### cards in total.


A new UI is being developed and it will take some time before it is finished. Forge is somewhat unstable at this time as the new user interface is a work in progress.

The first step was to update the battlefield window. The second step was to update the New Game window and this section still needs some work. We want to get constructed node and then quest modes working first and will then try to get the draft and sealed modes working again afterwards. While most of this work has now been done there are still a few areas that are not finished and you may discover a bug or two.

Enjoy the new work and be patient as this part of the project moves forward. For now, only "Constructed" mode is far enough along to be considered reasonably stable. Quest mode, Sealed and Draft are somewhat stable and you should be able to use these three modes without too many bugs and issues being noticed. Please report all bugs and issues that you notice.

The JuzamJedi cube has once again been updated with a newer list of cards. All core sets and all expansions should now be at least 75% implemented. And all standard legal sets are at least 90% complete.


Several people have noticed a crash report stating that "Buffers have not been created". We hope to have this fixed in the near future. It has been pointed out that:

"Parts of Swing use EventQueue by themselves, this means your Swing code executes in main thread part executes in EDT and as Swing isn't thread safe this leads to elusive errors like this. One of the reasons of this error is that the frame might not be fully constructed before buffers are created -> race condition between the threads."

Several people have noticed forge slowing down after playing a number of matches without quitting forge in between the matches that are played. The new UI may be involved somehow. We also hope to have this figured out and fixed in the near future. Please be patient in the meanwhile. A recent fix was implemented that should improve the slowdown problem somewhat.


The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove usefull. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

We have changed the archival format used for the Forge distributions from ".zip" to ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.


Fixes/Features:

- Cleared out the changes.txt file, is ready for new material.
