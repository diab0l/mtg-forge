Forge 06/12/2011 (unofficial BETA) version

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set 

http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)

8269 cards in total.

This version is based upon the revision # 9621 which is found on our SVN.


This version includes some new cards, bug fixes and a few new quest opponent decks. The developer mode at the new game window gives us a few new features to this option. These new features will primarily interest the devs as it will now help to test out specific cards while testing combat code changes.

We are working on a new Maven system of building the project and the OS specific archives that we release with each beta. The Maven script will help to automate the process and should require less time to prepare the beta releases.

We have added a new section to the readme.txt file and it states:

"The server which contained the high quality card pictures is now off line and these high quality card pictures are no longer available as a download from within the forge application. We apologize, but the current dev team do not maintain this server and this matter is out of our control.

Some people are choosing to re-download all of the low quality card and card set pictures when they install the next version of forge. This consumes large amounts of bandwidth needlessly.

The server containing the set pictures is limited to 30 gigs per month. At the current rate the server will hit the maximum of 30 gigs per month long before we reach the end of the month. Please be careful!

When you install the new version of forge find the forge/res/pics/ folder. Either move it or copy and paste the pics folder over to the recently installed new version of forge. This way you will only have to download the pictures for the new cards.

This should save enough bandwidth that everyone will be able to download the new set pictures from the cardforge server. We do appreciate your efforts to save bandwidth."


I found a utility to remove the hidden Mac-related files. I removed the ".SVN" and the /res/lib/ folders from this archive as they are not needed. We have changed the archiving format to ".tar.bz2" since this may help to store the file permissions for the Mac OS X launcher. There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these archives.


The Mac OS application version:

We have packaged the Forge 05/31/2011 BETA version as a Mac OS application. You can double click the Forge.app icon to launch the forge application on your Apple computer running Mac OS. This application will automatically increase the java heap space memory for you as it launches. This version does not require the forge.command file and it does not need to start the Terminal application as part of the start up process. This version should only require java 1.5.

You can move a copy of your pictures and decks over to the Forge.app application. Right click or control click on the Forge.app icon. Select Show Package Contents form the contextual menu. A Finder window will open and will display a folder named Contents. Navigate to the folder:

/Contents/Resources/Java/res/

Your decks can be placed in the decks folder, your pics can be placed in the pics folder, etc.


Fixes/Features:
