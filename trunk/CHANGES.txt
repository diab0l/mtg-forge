Forge Beta: ##-##-2012 ver 1.2.# rev #####

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)

10### cards in total.


This version is primarily a maintenance release. The deck converter bugs found in the previous version have been fixed. Version 1.2.5 includes some major changes to the new UI and to alternative costs. If you notice any new bugs in these two areas you should notify the devs.

When you select a new skin in the Preferences view Forge should save the change to the preference file, quit and then automatically re-launch with the new skin displayed. during testing some people have noticed that Forge is not restarting on their computer and they have to re-launch Forge themselves.

The zeppelin in quest mode has technical difficulties. We have a mechanic scheduled to look at it this weekend. :)


The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove usefull. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

We have changed the archival format used for the Forge distributions from ".zip" to ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
