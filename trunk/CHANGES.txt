Forge Beta: 0#-##-2012 ver 1.2.# rev #####

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)

10### cards in total.


We have reached a new milestone. All Modern legal sets are at least 80% complete and all Extended legal sets are at least 90% complete.

A number of bugs were found and fixed. The mana pool bug which caused crash reports was fixed. We also have a performance fix relating to static abilities. These reported bugs were also fixed: Avatar index bug, Quest opponent refresh, Avatar switch bug and Win streak (stats) not refreshing.

The UI has a few new features including the option to pick an avatars from a collection of pictures. This can be accessed from the Settings -> Avatars tab.

The organizational structure of the /res/decks/ folder has been improved and we now have these four subdirectories:

/decks/constructed/
/decks/cube/
/decks/draft/
/decks/sealed/

You can place your deck files from an earlier version of Forge into the /res/decks/ folder. When you next launch Forge these decks will be converted to a newer format and will be moved into the proper subdirectory.

You can now buy PreCon decks, Starter packs, Tournament packs and Fat packs from the quest mode card shop.


The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove usefull. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

We have changed the archival format used for the Forge distributions from ".zip" to ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
