Another test to try out.


Forge 05/31/2011 (unofficial BETA) version

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set 

http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)

8131 cards in total.

This version is based upon the revision # 9116 which is found on our SVN.


We have fixed some bugs, added some new cards, improved the AI in the draft mode, revised existing quest opponent decks and added new opponents, improved the AI's attacking and blocking code and improved the border around card images displayed in the new GUI battlefield.


I found a utility to remove the hidden Mac-related files. I removed the ".SVN" and the /res/lib/ folders from this archive as they are not needed. We have changed the archiving format to ".tar.bz2" since this may help to store the file permissions for the Mac OS X launcher. There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these archives.


The Mac OS application version:

We have packaged the Forge 05/31/2011 BETA version as a Mac OS application. You can double click the Forge.app icon to launch the forge application on your Apple computer running Mac OS. This application will automatically increase the java heap space memory for you as it launches. This version does not require the forge.command file and it does not need to start the Terminal application as part of the start up process. This version should only require java 1.5.

You can move a copy of your pictures and decks over to the Forge.app application. Right click or control click on the Forge.app icon. Select Show Package Contents form the contextual menu. A Finder window will open and will display a folder named Contents. Navigate to the folder:

/Contents/Resources/Java/res/

Your decks can be placed in the decks folder, your pics can be placed in the pics folder, etc.

If further discussion proves that this is too wrong or is not a good idea, feel free to revert/change as you see fit.

- Fix for a crash in Coldsnap draft (CSP/CSP/CSP) caused by the absence of standard basic lands in the CSP set (currently the basic lands are added from the 9th Edition core set, the set that was historically current at the moment when Coldsnap was released).
- Added RevealDiscardAll to AF_Discard.
- Converted Amnesia.
- Updated Wandering Goblins text.
- Converted Leeches to Cost/Target.
- Converted MercSearch to AFs.
- Corrected the rarity for Gelatinous Genesis.
- Gave Rage Nimbus an "IsCurse$ True" and it will now only target the human's creatures. Unfortunately, this still needs more work as the AI activates the Rage Nimbus ability during it's own turn. Card already has a remAI SVar.
- Added an "OptionalDecider$ You" to Angelic Benediction.
- Fixed the token image name for Gelatinous Genesis.
- A better and more universal fix for sets with no basic lands crashing after the draft is over. I added the fifth parameter to the set info in SetInfoUtil which defines where to take the basic lands from, the early sets which had no basic lands in them, such as Legends, will use the core set which was historically the latest at the moment of the set release; also, the Coldsnap draft will still use the 9th Edition lands since 9ED was the closest to Coldsnap.
- Lingering Delayed triggers are now removed at new game.
- Added a "Setup Battlefield" menu item to the Developer menu, currently doing nothing - to be expanded later for use to set up the battlefield for my AI experiments and improvement project.
- [WIP] More updates to the Setup Battlefield dev command, now allows to set specific cards for the human and AI hand, set up the specific human and AI life, and place specific cards on the battlefield. Not finished yet, does not yet register the cards on the battlefield properly for some reason. Will be fixed and updated ASAP.
- Minor documentation update for the Setup Battlefield dev command.
- Fixed state effects not being checked after Flameblast Dragons trigger as well as similar ones.
- Refactored the current Setup Battlefield code. Moved it to a separate method to clean up the menu creation function.
- Added some missing Legendary supertypes.
