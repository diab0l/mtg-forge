12### cards in total.


Release Notes:

User data migration
-------------------
User data, like decks, saved gauntlets, and card pictures, is now stored in separate directories from the program data.  When this version of Forge is first run, it will scan the program directory for all user data and automatically migrate all the files to their new homes.  There are three defined user data directores: userDir, cacheDir, and cardPicsDir, and their locations depend on the standard paths for your operating system:

    Windows:
        userDir=%APPDATA%/Forge/
        cacheDir=%LOCALAPPDATA%/Forge/Cache/ (or %APPDATA%/Forge/Cache/ for windows versions before the local/roaming directory split)
    OSX:
        userDir=$HOME/Library/Application Support/Forge/
        cacheDir=$HOME/Library/Caches/Forge/
    Linux:
        userDir=$HOME/.forge/
        cacheDir=$HOME/.cache/forge/

cardPicsDir is defined as <cacheDir>/pics/cards/ by default.  If you wish to use a non-default directory, please see the forge.profile.preferences.example file located in the Forge installation directory root.  You can use this file to, for example, share the card pics directory with another program, such as Magic Workstation.

For reference, here is the full list of moved directories:

Old location      New location
----------------  ----------------------
res/decks/        <userDir>/decks/
res/gauntlet/     <userDir>/gauntlet/
res/layouts/      <userDir>/preferences/
res/preferences/  <userDir>/preferences/
res/quest/data/   <userDir>/quest/saves/
res/pics/         <cacheDir>/pics/


New Import Data dialog
------------------------
The Import Pictures dialog, accessed via the Content Downloaders submenu, has received an overhaul and has been reincarnated as the Import Data dialog.  You may recognize it from the automatic data migration procedure if you had any data to migrate when this version was first started.  Instead of just importing pictures from a previous version of Forge, it can now import any kind of Forge data whatsoever.  If you have a directory full of deck files, you can use the Import Data dialog to copy or move them to the appropriate directory.  If you have just downloaded a torrent of high-quality pics for a particular set, use the Import Data dialog to get them to the proper place.  The dialog give you a full listing of all file copy/move operations, so you can see what will happen before you click 'Start Import'.


New User Preferences:
The display of clones and copied cards is now a matter of user preference. A user to now choose whether a clone/copied card should use its native artwork or the artwork of the card being cloned. So if Infinite Reflection is played and the "Clones use original card art" preference is checked, the cards that become copies of the enchanted card will still use their own art whereas by default they would all use the card art from the enchanted card.

Known Issues:

A small number of cards including Wall of Corpses, Abu Ja'far and others with a similar ability are not functional. The common issue here is actually that they check the blocker/attacker after being removed from the battlefield. Probably need to use LKI. Regular destroy/destroy all effects work just fine. The problem cards are caring about battlefield specific properties, that no longer apply when the base card is no longer on the battlefield.

On several occasions people have noticed that the forge deck editor and/or quest mode card shop would not open or display. We have also received reports that some of the tabs/panels in the deck editor are missing. Try deleting the file named "editor_preferred.xml" which is found in the "res/layouts" folder. This should force forge to then use the "editor_default.xml" file instead.

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with each other. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there are two remaining issues that we hope will be addressed in the near future.

1. Leave play triggers don't work correct for clones.
2. Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

There is currently a known issue with some of the cards that have effects triggering after the card goes to graveyard (e.g. Wall of Corpses, Abu Ja'Far) not working correctly.

Forge is likely to be compatible with Java 7 at this time. Some people have used forge with Java 7 and have not reported any problems that are related to Java 7. If you would like to upgrade to Java 7 and have held off because of Forge then you may upgrade as we do not think that it will cause an incompatibility type of problem. We will continue to try to maintain compatibility with Java 6 for the foreseeable future.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
