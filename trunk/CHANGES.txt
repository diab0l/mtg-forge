Release Notes
-------------

- Window size/position now remembered between sessions -
Works with multiple monitors.
Remembers whether the window was maximized or un-maximized.
The first time you launch Forge after this update, the window will be maximized on default monitor, with 800x600 centered being used if you un-maximize. This matches how it worked before.
Remembers last un-maximized size even if the window is currently maximized such that, if you un-maximize the window, it will restore to that size at the center of the current monitor.
Window will be made accessible even if monitor setup or screen resolution is different between sessions.


- Card Zoomer Updates -
- The Card Zoomer/Preview now supports split, flip and double-sided cards including cards played face down (eg. morph).
- Split cards (name contains "//") are now rotated 90 degrees for easier viewing.
- If a card is a flip- or double-sided card then you can easily view the alternate image using...
  - wheel mode : flick wheel forward or tap CTRL key.
  - button mode : tap CTRL key.
- The standard flip graphic (the two rotated arrows) is displayed if the card can be flipped or transformed.


- Home Screen UI Improvements -
The menu on the Home Screen is now scrollable using either a mouse wheel or arrow buttons that will appear at the top or bottom if scrolling can occur in that direction
The Deck Editor and Exit Forge buttons are now laid out vertically to make it easier to add launch buttons for new screens coming down the pipeline (hint, hint...)
The menu on the Home Screen has been made narrower and the logo size increased to decrease whitespace and increase the width of the main panel
Release notes added to Games Settings section.


- User Preferences -
There's a new user preference that lets you choose whether a 0-cost block should prompt you to pay or to pay it automatically. This only affects blocking situations where you would have to actually pay 0, (e.g. War Cadence with X = 0). By default you'll be prompted for payment, allowing you to, for instance, prevent forced blocks by activating War Cadence for 0 then not paying the block cost.


- Forge now requires Java 7 -
Please update your Java runtime environment. At this point Forge versions 1.4.2 and above will no longer run under Java 6.


- New M14 cards -
Forge now includes most of the new M14 cards. It may take a few days before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient.


- Match and Deck Editor Layout problems -
The match and deck editor windows contain panels that can be moved and/or resized. The changes that you make are saved to files that are named "editor.xml" and "match.xml". These files can be found in your userDir/preferences/ directory.

Sometimes people will decide that they do not like the changes that they made and wish to go back to the original layout. To reset layouts to default, go to the Game Settings -> Preferences -> Troubleshooting section. You will find at this location two buttons that will reset the match layout and the deck editor layouts.

Also use the mentioned measure if your match or deckeditor won't start - it would help in 90% of the cases.


- The Mac OS X application -
At this time Forge now requires Java 7 and will no longer run under Java 6.

Unfortunately, the Mac OS X builder that we were using does not support Java 7. We hope to find and to use a different Mac OS X builder in order to continue releasing a Mac OS bundled application like we have in the past.

Currently, the windows/unix release of Forge includes a launcher file named "forge.command". Double click on the "forge.command" launcher command file and this will in turn launch the Forge jar file via the terminal application while increasing the Java heap space. This should be a temporary inconvenience.

Known Issues
------------

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with each other. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there is one remaining issue that we hope will be addressed in the near future:
Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
