Installation Instructions:
--------------------------

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.

Once the Forge archive has been decompressed you should then be able to launch Forge by using the included launcher. Launching Forge by double clicking on the forge jar file in the past caused a java heap space error. Forge's memory requirements have increased over time and the launchers increase the java heap space available to Forge. Currently you can launch Forge by double clicking on the forge jar file without a java heap space error but this is likely to change as we add in more sounds, icons, etc.


Updating to a newer version Instructions:
-----------------------------------------

The instructions that were found in this section are now out of date. Current instructions can be found in the CHANGES.txt and forge.profile.properties.example files.


Advanced Updating to a newer version Instructions:
--------------------------------------------------

The instructions that were found in this section are now out of date. Current instructions can be found in the CHANGES.txt and forge.profile.properties.example files.


The Mac OS application version:
-------------------------------

We have packaged the Forge BETA version as a Mac OS application. You can double click the Forge.app icon to launch the forge application on your Apple computer running Mac OS. This application will automatically increase the java heap space memory for you as it launches. This version does not require the forge.command file and it does not need to start the Terminal application as part of the start up process.

If you update your OS to Apple OSX 10.8 Mountain Lion and try to launch a new version of forge that you will likely get a dialog which states "File is damaged and cannot be opened. Please move to trash." 

Mountain Lion comes with a new Gatekeeper feature and this is probably blocking your ability to launch this newer version of forge. Visit the link below and follow the instructions. They are fairly long and detailed.

http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US

Please note that the issue is most likely caused by Mountain Lion's Gatekeeper feature and it is extremely unlikely that the forge dev team will attempt to get a unique Developer ID from Apple and use it to digitally sign our forge app.

Launching Forge and Memory Issues:
----------------------------------

In the past, some people noticed java heap space errors and lengthy pauses. The memory requirements for Forge have increased over time. The default setting on your computer for the java heap space may not be enough to prevent the above problems.

The technically proficient can launch the forge jar with an argument from the CLI. The argument "-Xmx512m" may work for computers with 1 Gig of memory. Computers with 2 Gigs or more of memory should be able to use "-Xmx1024m" as an argument.

We have created several scripts that will launch the Forge jar with "-Xmx1024m" as an argument. People using Windows OS should double click the "forge.exe" file. People using one of the other *nix OS should double click the "forge.sh" file. People using Apple's Mac OS X should download the Mac version of Forge and then double click the "forge.app" application.

The script file must be located in the same folder as the Forge jar file and the Forge jar file name can not be changed. Otherwise, the scripts will not work.

If you have a low end machine you may find that the scripts above will prevent java heap space errors but will find that Forge still runs very slowly at times.

In this case you can try the following. You can try using low quality pictures rather than the high quality pictures. Or you can try removing all of the jpg pictures from the pics folder.


Forge failed to launch:
-----------------------

If you're trying to run Forge for the first time, but it doesn't open up, you can try the following to get some output and help yourself/us solve the problem.

1) Open up a terminal
- Under Windows, press Windows+R, type "cmd", hit enter
- Under Linux, you probably know that yourself. Use your distribution's application menu, and search for "terminal" in a group like "utilities".
- Launch the program named "Console.app" which can be found in your /Applications/Utilities/ folder. Highlight the "All Messages" option and click on the "Clear Display" button before launching Forge.

2) Go to the folder where you unpacked Forge
- Windows: Let's say your forge is in D:\Programs\Forge.
- Type "D:", Enter to change to the D: drive.
- Type "cd \Programs\Forge", Enter to change to the directory.
- NOTE: On nonenglish systems, you might have problems due to the poor localization of Windows. Go to the innermost directory you find (worst case is "\"), then "dir", Enter to show all folders in that folder. Search for the one you're probably wanting. For Example the German "Programme" could really be "Program Files" or something like that.
- NOTE: You might have to "quote" directory names with Spaces in them
- Linux: Let's say your forge is in /home/user/Forge
- Type "cd /home/user/Forge", Enter
- NOTE: You might have to "quote" or 'quote' directory names with Spaces in them
- Current versions of Forge no longer include a launcher script for Mac OS, proceed to step three.

3) Run Forge
- On Windows, just type "forge.exe", Enter
- On Linux, just type "forge.sh", Enter
- Launch the Forge application bundle by double clicking on the program named "Forge.app".

Now you will probably see some sort of Error in the console. the first few lines contain a message that might help you. If you can't fix the problem yourself, please take the complete output and report your problem on the Forum.


The Card Pictures disappear when you restart Forge:
---------------------------------------------------

if you're running Windows 7, make sure you're running the program as an admin, otherwise no changes will be made to your system (nothing is saved). In Windows 7, Forge may be happier when run from somewhere in the My Documents structure, (they call them Libraries now???) or from another partition other than C:. The user has little permission to do much on the system drive.


Java Issues:
------------

Forge is likely to be compatible with Java 7 at this time. Some people have used forge with Java 7 and have not reported any problems that are related to Java 7. If you would like to upgrade to Java 7 and have held off because of Forge then you may upgrade as we do not think that it will cause an incompatibility type of problem. We will continue to try to maintain compatibility with Java 6 for the foreseeable future.

Forge requires Java 6 and will not run if you have an earlier version of Java. You will need to update to Java 6.


Card Picture Issues:
--------------------

The server which contained the high quality card pictures is now off line and these high quality card pictures are no longer available as a download from within the forge application. We apologize, but the current dev team do not maintain this server and this matter is out of our control.

Some people are choosing to re-download all of the low quality card and card set pictures when they install the next version of forge. This consumes large amounts of bandwidth needlessly. Please be careful!


The instructions that were found in this section are now out of date. Current instructions can be found in the CHANGES.txt and forge.profile.properties.example files.


When you install a new version of Forge, please follow the instructions that can be found in the CHANGES.txt and forge.profile.properties.example files. This will allow you to reuse your previous picture files and other user data files. This way you will only have to download the pictures for the new cards.

This should save enough bandwidth that everyone will be able to download the new set pictures from the cardforge server. We do appreciate your efforts to save bandwidth. Thank you.


Reporting Bugs:
---------------

To report a bug with an official beta release, please follow the instructions at http://www.slightlymagic.net/wiki/Forge#I_think_I_found_a_bug_in_Forge._What_do_I_do.3F .

To report a bug (1) with an alpha test, (2) with a nightly build, (3) with something compiled from the official Forge software repository, or (4) with the leading edge (formerly "SVN Bug Reports"), please do not submit your bugs to the forum. Instead, please follow the instructions at http://www.slightlymagic.net/wiki/How_to_File_a_Bug_Report_with_Mantis.

Forge will now allow you to upload a crash report to the Forge forum at CCGH.


A new very hard tier category in Quest mode:
--------------------------------------------

You will notice a new very hard tier category for the opponent. As you change from the previous tier to the next tier (easy to medium, etc.) you will now notice that there is not an abrupt change over. There is now a mixture of decks from the previous tier and the next tier for you to chose from. When you win a match you will complete the advancement to the next tier.


The Forge Booster Draft mode:
-----------------------------

A significant re-write of the Booster Draft functionality has taken place. Draft from the Full card pool, sets/blocks or custom drafts (like cube). The AI will pick cards more intelligently, and builds decks from picked cards. Old method would pick cards for deck and then stop picking new cards.


The developer mode:
-------------------

The developer mode gives us a few new features. These new features will primarily interest the devs as it will now help to test out specific cards while testing combat code changes. You can turn on or off this mode at the Home View -> Game Settings -> Preferences -> Gameplay Options section.

When turned on the battlefield will have a tab named "Dev Mode". There are a number of useful options in this tab. You can disable loss by milling, generate mana in your mana pool, tutor for card, etc.


New foil card image available:
------------------------------

Rob and Marc have worked together to add in a new feature which will overlay a card's image with a foil like film. A few random cards will have a foil like image in constructed mode games and possibly quest mode games. There is a check box on the Home View -> Game Settings -> Preferences view that you can use to turn this feature on or off.


Informational icons overlays for cards on the battlefield:
----------------------------------------------------------

The Battlefield will now display three symbolic icons that will overlay creature cards. These icons are used to denote summoning sickness and whether a creature is attacking or blocking.  Added additional icons that will be drawn over the cards in the battlefield for phasing and counters at a later date. The attack/block/phasing icons and counters will now also be shown on large cards, only casting cost will be omitted. Lands and tokens with different amounts/types of counters will no longer stack. Tokens with different summoning sickness will no longer stack. Lands that become creatures will now always be moved to the front row.


Optional choice for abilities that are on the stack:
----------------------------------------------------

When a spell or an ability appears on the stack and it says "(OPTIONAL)" you can right-click it to decide if you want to always accept or to decline it.


Multiple quest files:
---------------------
 
Multiple quest files are now supported. This allows you to start a new quest and give it a unique name, and it will not overwrite your previous quest game file.


The new UI now uses tabbed panes:
---------------------------------

We now have a tab system for sub-menus in the home screen. Quest mode refactored to fit this tab system. It's now considerably easier to use - less cramped, less clicks, more functionality.


The quest mode card shop:
-------------------------

You can now buy PreCon decks, Starter packs, Tournament packs and Fat packs from the quest mode card shop.


Player Avatar pictures:
-----------------------

The UI has a few new features including the option to pick an avatar from a collection of pictures. This can be accessed from the Settings -> Avatars tab.


The organizational structure of the /res/decks/ folder:
-------------------------------------------------------

The organizational structure of the /res/decks/ folder has been improved and we now have these six subdirectories:

/decks/constructed/
/decks/cube/
/decks/draft/
/decks/plane/
/decks/scheme/
/decks/sealed/

You can place your deck files from an earlier version of Forge into the /res/decks/ folder. When you next launch Forge these decks will be converted to a newer format and will be moved into the proper subdirectory.

Please not that your /decks/ directory no longer resides in you /res/ directory and has been moved to <userDir>/decks/.


User-created themes for Forge's background, fonts, colors and icons:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When you select a new skin in the Preferences view Forge should save the change to the preference file, quit and then automatically re-launch with the new skin displayed. During testing some people have noticed that Forge is not restarting on their computer and they have to re-launch Forge themselves.

If anyone is interested in creating additional themes for inclusion in the Forge project then you should visit this topic at CCGH:

http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=8449


The Battlefield UI:
-------------------

The Battlefield UI has a new feature implemented which allows us to move and resize the panels to new places on the battlefield. This allows us to personalize the battlefield display to our own liking. You should try moving panels by clicking and dragging their tabs.

If you do not like your efforts to personalize the battlefield display you can revert the display to the default layout by clicking on the Dock button labeled "Revert layout".


The pets in quest mode:
-----------------------

Some adjustments to the pets in quest mode were made. The quest mode plant wall's Deathtouch ability was deemed to be too strong against the AI's attack code and this ability was changed to Wither in this version. This includes a new pet.


The dock tab has a new button labeled "Open Layout":
----------------------------------------------------

The dock now has a new button labeled "Open Layout" along with old button with original function "Revert Layout". Modifying the battlefield layout will result in your changes being saved to a file named  "match_preferred.xml". You can copy and rename that file to share your layouts with other people.


The new Deck Editors:
---------------------

The work on the new UI is now finished and this version adds the new UI to the deck editors. We all would like to thank Doublestrike for his contributions to the new UI.

The new deck editors include:

* a better text search (can search for multiple terms, and "not" terms
* interval filters for P/T and CMC
* add/remove 4
* better statistics and draw probabilities
* Toggle-able, sort-able, resize-able, move-able columns
* and of course uses the drag cell layout.


Performance issues on low end machines:
---------------------------------------

Several people have noticed forge slowing down after playing a number of matches without quitting forge in between the matches that are played. The new UI may be involved somehow. We also hope to have this figured out and fixed in the near future. Please be patient in the meanwhile. A recent fix was implemented that should improve the slowdown problem somewhat.

A lot of time and effort have gone into fixing the memory leak problems that were recently noticed and reported to the dev team. Doublestrike and Slapshot deserve our applause and we are very thankful. People should be able to now play long multi match sessions without noticing slow downs and pauses.

Some performance changes were made to Forge and it should now operate more quickly on low end machines. Mid to high level machines are unlikely to notice as much of a performance increase. We tried to hunt down all of the bugs that resulted from these changes but there may still be a bug or two in this beta release.


A note about winning booster packs in quest mode:
-------------------------------------------------

If you win a quest mode match, you get a booster pack for every 1 or 2 (default) Wins, depending on the difficulty level. If you lose and you are playing on easy mode, you get a booster pack every 1 (default) Loss.


The new UI:
-----------

The first step was to update the battlefield window. The second step was to update the New Game window (now named Home view). We got constructed mode and then quest modes working first. We got the draft and sealed modes working again afterwards.

The work on the new UI is now for the most part finished. We should not expect major changes or major additions to the UI. Future betas may include a few minor bug fixes to the UI. And we may also include a few minor tweaks.


The new Alpha Strike button:
----------------------------

A new Alpha Strike button was added to the dock. The Dock is one of the tabs availble in the battlefield view.


Using Forge with the new Mac OS Mountain Lion:
----------------------------------------------

If you update your OS to Apple OSX 10.8 Mountain Lion and try to launch a new version of forge that you will likely get a dialog which states "File is damaged and cannot be opened. Please move to trash." 

Mountain Lion comes with a new Gatekeeper feature and this is probably blocking your ability to launch this newer version of forge. Visit the link below and follow the instructions. They are fairly long and detailed.

http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US

Please note that the issue is most likely caused by Mountain Lion's Gatekeeper feature and it is extremely unlikely that the forge dev team will attempt to get a unique Developer ID from Apple and use it to digitally sign our forge app.


The Forge sealed deck mode:
---------------------------

Sealed Deck mode has had a complete rewrite. Full cardpool, block and custom modes are supported. Custom sealed files in the res/sealed folder are exactly the same as custom draft files, except the file extension ".sealed".

A distinction may now be made between AI decks and Human decks, with the addition of a deck Metadata "PlayerType", which right now just helps by sorting human decks into the human combo box and AI decks into the AI combo box.

The Forge sealed deck mode has undergone significant changes. You can find these in the 1.2.14 beta and later versions. Instead of a single sealed deck match, you can now choose a 1-5 round gauntlet-style tournament where you will face increasingly difficult (probably) opponent decks. You can also choose to use starter packs instead of boosters in the block mode, choose to use 3-12 boosters instead of the default 6 in the full cardpool and custom (cube) modes, and so on.

Perhaps the most notable changes to the sealed deck mode are related to "fantasy blocks" and the greatly increased flexibility you have when you are building your own blocks.


The new Gauntlet mode:
----------------------

A new Gauntlet mode has been added. This mode gives you four options: Quick Gauntlet, Build A Gauntlet, Load Gauntlet and Gauntlet Contests. You can create a group of computer decks to play against by choosing either Custom user decks, Quest Decks, Fully random color decks or Semi-random theme decks.


The new Variant mode (was named Multiplayer):
---------------------------------------------

A new multiplayer mode has also been added. You should be able to play against multiple AI opponents at this time. You should note that the current Archenemy mode does not use Schemes at this time.

A lot of things are planned for this new multiplayer mode and it will take time to finish. Please enjoy what we have at this time and be patient. :)

Since Multiplayer is so new, not all cards will be 100% compatible right away as we expand scripting to handle multiple players.

The older match layout files are incompatible with the new multiplayer mode. The original match_default.xml, match_preferred.xml and the match_preferred.xml saved to a different name files have to go and can no longer be used. You can keep your editor_preferred.xml file. But you will have to setup your match view panels using the new match_default.xml file.


The new damage dialog:
----------------------

The new damage dialog now uses the new UI.


When choosing cards, sources, etc. using a list box:
----------------------------------------------------

When choosing cards, sources, etc. using a list box, the currently selected card will now be visually highlighted on the play field (to better distinguish between e.g. three different cards with the same name on the play field). Now the visual highlighting of a card will also work when declaring the order of blockers.


Return to Ravnica Guild Sealed Deck mode:
-----------------------------------------

Added Return to Ravnica Guild Sealed Deck mode. Start a new sealed deck game, choose "Block / Set" and then scroll down until you find "Return to Ravnica Guild Sealed (block)". Select that. From the "Choose Set Combination" menu, select the first option. You will be prompted twice to pick your guild (once for the promo cards, once for the actual booster - you should choose the same guild both times). After that you're ready to go.


Targeting arrows are now available in the battlefield display:
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Targeting Overlay has been fixed and re-enabled. It now correctly shows the targeting arcs in cases when it previously showed them in the wrong direction. The match UI is properly refreshed when the targeting arcs are switched on/off. The defunct "mouseover-only" mode is currently disabled (it crashes Forge, difficult to fix).

The visuals for targeting arrows has been improved and looks better, with an adaptation of the arrow drawing code from MAGE. Thanks to the MAGE team for permission for the adaptation.


The new sound system:
---------------------

Forge now has a sound effect system in place. Several basic sounds are linked to the code now and will be enabled when "Enable Sounds" option is checked in the preferences. It supports WAV and AU file formats.

Currently supported sound effects are:
(the ones already available in the standard installation of Forge are marked with a [*])

AddCounter [*] - add_counter.wav - triggered when a counter is added to a permanent.
Artifact[*] - artifact.wav - triggered when an artifact is played.
ArtifactCreature [*] - artifact_creature.wav - triggered when an artifact creature is played.
BlackLand [*] - black_land.wav - triggered when a land with the "B" mana ability is played.
Block [*] - block.wav - triggered when a blocker is assigned.
BlueLand [*] - blue_land.wav - triggered when a land with the "U" mana ability is played.
Creature [*] - creature.wav - triggered when a creature is played.

WinDuel [*] - win_duel.wav - triggered when a player wins the duel.

All sounds use the event bus model now and are not called directly.


The new Vanguard mode:
----------------------

We now have a Vanguard mode implemented. This is a work in progress. The older match layout files are incompatible with the new Vanguard mode. The original match_default.xml, match_preferred.xml and the match_preferred.xml saved to a different name files need to be deleted and can no longer be used. You can keep your editor_preferred.xml file. But you will have to setup your match view panels using the new match_default.xml file.


The new Archenemy mode:
-----------------------

Schemes have been added to the Archenemy mode. This is a work in progress and there may be a bug or two for us to find.


Quest Worlds:
-------------

This version allows you to travel between the regular quest world and the other worlds (Shandalar, Ravnica, Jamuraa, more may be added in the future) to get different duel opponents and challenges. You will have to complete your current challenges before traveling or you will lose them. 

World-specific format enforcing and starting world selection are available. Something has to be done about locked (non-repeatable) challenges so they do not end up locking other challenges in different worlds.


Forge now has sideboards for the human player:
----------------------------------------------

Sideboards have been implemented for Human players. We currently have:

* Sideboard creation support in relevant deck editor modes.
* In-game sideboarding with persistence between rounds in a match and sorting of cards in the in-game sideboard editor.
* Sideboard supported as a zone, with some relevant cards already in.
* Correct validation of decks, both before the game starts and between the rounds (Limited min 40, Constructed min 60, free-form sideboard/main in Draft and Sealed, 1:1 sideboarding with 0 or 15 cards allowed in sideboard in Constructed (all variants) and Quest; OK to have less than minimum between rounds in a match in all modes if lost cards on ante).
* Correct (fingers crossed) interaction of sideboarding with other relevant aspects of Forge rule enforcement (mulligan and ante interactions were corrected, initial hand and library between rounds were both corrected, everything else looks so far so good).

We don't yet have:

* AI sideboarding.


The deck conformance/legality limitation:
-----------------------------------------

The deck conformance/legality is now a user-toggable preference and is enabled by default. You no longer need to turn on dev mode to play an illegal deck.


Using Forge on displays that are only 600 pixels tall or slightly larger:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "Sanctioned Format: Constructed" view should now be compatible with displays that are only 600 pixels tall. The deck list at 600 pixels tall should now display three lines of text rather than less than a single line of text.


We are looking for help in finding additional sound files for the new sound feature:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This version of forge includes a few sound files for the new sound effect system. While we have several sounds assigned to a few of the available events there are a number of events that do not yet have a assigned sound file. This should be considered a work in progress and we could use some help in finding interesting sounds that we can add to forge.

The sound files need to be in wav or au format, wav appears to be more widespread but the code can handle either format. The sound files need to be copyright-free and they should be in the public domain.

You can either record your own sounds if you have the necessary equipment or you may be able to find an appropriate sound on a website such as http://www.freesound.org/browse/

You should note that sound files can be large and we would like to avoid this if possible. A good size to shoot for would be 50 K or less. There is a freeware sound editor that may have versions for all operating systems. This app is named Audacity.

We have a forge forum topic at the Collectible Card Games Headquarters web site that is devoted to finding sounds for this new sound system. Please visit this topic and contribute a sound or two. We can use your help and assistance. :)

Notes about the second Quest World, Jamuraa:
--------------------------------------------

A second Quest World, Jamuraa, has been added to Forge. When playing Quest mode, it is now possible to 'Travel' between the regular Quest environment and the two Worlds, Shandalar and Jamuraa, both of which include special formats, opponents and challenges. Or you can start a new Quest in any of them.

Like Shandalar, Jamuraa is a fantasy world. Its peaceful existence has recently been wrecked by a planar conjunction that shattered the barriers between Jamuraa and the infernal planes known as Jahim, Saqar, and Jahannam. The demon planeswalkers who rule those planes, and their hellish sister, Lilith, are now extending their influence over Jamuraa and gradually destroying the whole continent. Your task is to fight their minions and ultimately challenge the four demons - but beware, their destructive might is unfathomable!

From a technical perspective, the following sets are available to the player in Jamuraa: 
5th Edition, Arabian Nights, Mirage, Visions, Weatherlight.

Jamuraa contains:
- 81 opponent decks, broken down as follows: 13 'easy' decks, 17 'medium' decks, 31 'hard' decks, and 20 'very hard' decks.
- 9 challenges, including the 4 demon planeswalkers (the 3 demon rulers and Lilith) and 5 other special scenarios set in Jamuraa. All challenges are repeatable. All are fairly hard, and the 4 demon challenges are especially fiendish.
For the most part, the opponent duel and challenge decks are built with the same format restrictions as your own cardpool, and some of the easiest opponent decks were in fact based on a limited cardpool. But there will be exceptions, especially in the hard/very hard decks and challenges, which can be more like Vintage/T1 decks than pure Mirage + 5th Edition decks. There will be older cards here and there, and maybe even a random Tempest card or two (although these are extremely scarce!). 
Hint: if you find the later 'Vintage' opponent decks unfair or near-impossible to beat with your 5th Edition/Mirage block cards, you can Travel to Shandalar and collect some old power cards there, and then return to Jamuraa. Just remember to complete your challenges before traveling.

Information on the quest worlds format can be found in this topic:

New Deck Editor features with improved Filters:
-----------------------------------------------

Some work is being done on the various deck editors -- including the quest spell shop -- and we hope to add in additional features while improving the UI. Here is a quick tutorial on the new features:

FILTERS
The Filters tab has been removed and filters are now controlled from the Card Catalog tab. Pretty much everything that used to be a checkbox is now represented by a toggle button. The statistics labels at the top for colors and card types can now be clicked to toggle display of the related cards. Clicking the Total Cards label in the upper left will alternately set all filters on and off.

Text searches are done by just typing the the text box. The results will update as you type. Use the combo box to the right of the text box to set whether the search should be for cards with or without the specified text. The three toggle buttons to the right of the combo box allow you to specify where in the card the text should (or should not) match. Complex text searches, such as for goblin creatures with haste but not with kicker costs, are possible by stacking the search filters. Put the current search filter on the stack by selecting the "Add filter" button to the left of the text box and choosing the "Current text search" option. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on OSX). This will keep your current text search applied, but will clear the text box and allow you to input the next search filter. To perform the example goblin search above, you would:
1) Ensure "in" is displayed in the the combo box. Enter "goblin" in the text box and deselect Name and Text so that only Type is selected.
2) Hit Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on OSX). Notice the "Contains: 'goblin" in: type" filter appears below the text box.
3) Type "haste" in the text box. Deselect Type and select Text. Hit Ctrl+Enter.
4) Change the combo box from "in" to "not in". Type "kicker" in the text box.
The shown entries match your combined search filter. Click the little 'x' in the upper right corner of each search widget to remove that filter from the filter stack.

Format filters allow you to restrict the shown cards to those that are legal in a particular format. Select the "Add filter" button, hover over the "Format" submenu, and choose one of the defined formats. The filter will appear below the text box and will be combined with whatever other filters you have on the stack. Hover the mouse over the filter widget to see details on allowed sets and banned cards. Keep in mind that cards from other, non-listed sets may still appear in the results if they are just reprints of allowed cards.

Set filters are similar to format filters except that a window will come up with a grid of checkboxes so you can select exactly which sets you would like shown. There is a checkbox at the bottom (off by default) that will allow the filter to include cards reprinted in unselected sets, just like the format filter above. If you don't check this checkbox, only cards printed in the selected sets will be shown, allowing you to focus on just that set's version of a particular card. This is very useful in quest mode when determining which cards in a set you have yet to collect.

Value range filters allow you to restrict the cards by power, toughness, and/or converted mana cost (CMC). The text boxes that appear in the filter widget are editable and update the shown cards in realtime as you modify the numbers.

Quest World filters are similar to Format filters in that they restrict the shown cards to a group of sets, respecting lists of banned cards. They are useful when constructing decks that will be valid in the various quest worlds. You can have more than one quest world filter active at the same time; useful if you are constructing a deck that will be used in multiple worlds.

SPELL SHOP
The spell shop interface has also received some usability enhancements. The first one you may notice is the addition of a new column named "Owned". This column is intended to help players decide whether buying an item is likely to be beneficial. The data in this column varies depending on what kind of item the row represents:
Cards: A number indicating how many of a particular card a player already owns
Preconstructed decks: A "YES" or "NO" indicating whether the deck exists in the player's deck list
Booster/fat packs: A percentage indicating how close a player is to completing the related set.  "Complete" means at least one of every basic land and at least 4 of every other card.
If you don't want this column, it can be turned off in the editor preferences.

The new "Sell excess cards" button appears above the player's library. Clicking it will sell all cards that are not basic lands until only four copies of the cards remain. It's a one-click "cleanup" of the library and a great way to safely and quickly regain some cash.

The "Full catalog view" button appears to the left of the "Buy Card" button. Toggling this button will switch between showing the store's inventory and the full catalog. By applying a filter to show only a particular set (or group of sets), players can use this view to discover exactly which cards they do not own. Buying and selling cards is disabled while in this view.

Multibuy: By selecting any number of items and hitting space (or selecting the "Buy Card" or "Sell Card" buttons), a player can buy one of everything selected.

Find-as-you-type is now implemented for Deck Editor tables. Just start typing while the table has focus and the next card with a matching string in its name will be highlighted. If more than one card matches, hit Enter to select the next matching card. A popup panel will appear with the search string so you know what you are searching for. If no cards match the string, the string will be highlighted in red. Normally, if you hit the spacebar while a card is selected in one table, the card will be moved to the other table (catalog/deck). When the popup is displayed, space characters are interpreted as part of the search string. Find-as-you-type mode is automatically exited after 5 seconds of inactivity, or hit Escape to exit find-as-you-type mode immediately.

The Deck Editor has also gained some hotkey and context menu abilities. R-click on a card (or a group of selected cards) for a list of actions and keyboard shortcuts. In particular, you can now transfer cards 4 at a time using the keyboard and interact with the sideboard from anywhere. Also remember that you can jump to the other table with the arrow keys and jump to the text filter with ctrl/cmd+f. From the text filter, you can jump down to the tables by pressing enter.


The Game Log:
-------------

Added a 'copy to clipboard' button on WinLose screen so players can easily copy the game log.


The UI is more keyboard-friendly:
---------------------------------

Work was also done on making the UI more keyboard-friendly. For example, the OK button should now stay focused during matches, so you can advance through the stages by hitting Enter without having to go over and click the button all the time. If you find the button is losing focus, please report it as a bug.


Gatecrash Guild Sealed game mode:
---------------------------------

Gatecrash Guild Sealed game mode has been added. To use it, start a new Sealed Mode Game, select "Block / Set" and "Gatecrash Guild Sealed". Select the first (default) configuration in the "Choose Set Combination" dialog, and when asked to pick your boosters, choose the guild you want twice (once for the guild-specific booster, and then for the extra promo cards). 

The following cards are not included in the guild boosters of this game mode because they are not currently implemented in Forge: Bane Alley Broker, Bioshift, Killing Glare, Simic Manipulator.
