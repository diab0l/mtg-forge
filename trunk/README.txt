Installation and Updating to a newer version Instructions:

We have changed the archival format used for the Forge distributions from ".zip" to ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Once the Forge archive has been decompressed you should then be able to launch Forge by using the included launcher. Launching Forge by double clicking on the forge jar file will cause a java heap space error. Forge's memory requirements have increased over time and the launchers increase the java heap space available to Forge.

After downloading and installing a newer version of Forge you may want to move certain files from the older version over to the newer version of Forge. You should maintain your older version of Forge as a back up in case you make a mistake while installing the newer version.

1) The /res/pics/ folder contains the card pictures, icons and token pictures (mtg card tokens and quest pet/plant tokens). Please note that the /res/images/icons/ folder was moved back to the /res/pics/icons/ folder. The forge /res/images/ folder no longer is used as of version 1.2.8.

The /res/pics/icons/ folder contains the quest opponent icons, small quest pet/plant icons (non-tokens) and some icons that are used by forge's quest mode. While several of these pictures ship with the forge archive most of them have to be downloaded using the Home screen -> Utilities -> Download Quest Images command.

2) The /res/pics_product/ folder contains four folders which in turn contain pictures for the booster, fatpacks, precons and tournamentpacks products.

3) The /res/decks/ folder contains your deck files. You should copy over the files with the extension ".dck". In version 1.2.4 and later the /decks/ folder contains 4 subdirectories named constructed, cube, draft and sealed.

You can place your deck files from an earlier version of Forge into the /res/decks/ folder. When you next launch Forge these decks will be converted to a newer format and will be moved into the proper subdirectory.

4) The /res/draft/ and the /res/sealed/ folders contains files for the sealed and draft mode. You should copy over your files inside of these folders that end in the extension ".draft" or ".zsealed".

5) The /res/quest/data folder contains your questData files. These files include all of the information for your current quests. You will not be able to continue your quests in a newer version of Forge unless you copy over the your quest data files. These files have a ".dat" extension. You can now have multiple ongoing quests at the same time.

6) The Forge /res/preferences/ folder contains the preference files named "forge.preferences" and "editor.preferences". You should also move a copy of these files over to the newer version. The /res/preferences/ folder was added to version 1.2.8.

7) The /res/layouts/ folder contains a file named "match_preferred.xml". This file contains information that forge uses when setting the layout for the battlefield display.


Advanced Updating to a newer version Instructions:

Another option for you to consider is to move some of the files/folders listed above to a different location on your hard drive. Then edit the "main.properties" file in the /res/ folder with any basic text editor. At the "image/base--file=pics" and "image/token--file=pics/tokens". Just change these to absolute paths of your choice eg:

image/base--file=F:/Personal/CardForge/Low Resolution Images

image/token--file=F:/Personal/CardForge/Low Resolution Images/tokens

and do the same for "decks-dir--file=decks", "quest--properties=quest/quest.properties" and whatever else you might usually copy from version to version. Try to avoid folders that are usually updated in the releases. Just remember to use forward slashes for the pathnames. Then just copy the "main.properties" file from version to version. Occasionally compare it to the release version to make sure nothing else has changed, and if it has just replace the adjusted lines instead.


The Mac OS application version:

We have packaged the Forge BETA version as a Mac OS application. You can double click the Forge.app icon to launch the forge application on your Apple computer running Mac OS. This application will automatically increase the java heap space memory for you as it launches. This version does not require the forge.command file and it does not need to start the Terminal application as part of the start up process.

You can move a copy of your pictures and decks over to the "Forge.app" application. Right click or control click on the Forge.app icon. Select "Show Package Contents" from the contextual menu. A Finder window will open and will display a folder named Contents. Navigate to the folder:

/Contents/Resources/Java/res/

Your decks can be placed in the decks folder, your pics can be placed in the pics folder, etc.


Picture location info:

The quest opponent icons jpg picture files go into your /res/images/icons folder. Please note that the /res/pics/icons/ folder was moved out of this folder and placed in the /res/images/ folder.

The quest booster package jpg picture files go into your /res/pics/booster folder. The card token jpg picture files go into your /res/pics/tokens folder.

The quest pets archive contains two subdirectories named "icons" and "tokens". Place the files located inside of the /icons/ folder into the /res/images/icons/ folder. Place the files located inside of the /tokens/ folder into the /res/pics/tokens/ folder.

Your forge game may not come with one or more of these three folders as part of the forge archive. In this case you should use your computer's OS file system to create the proper folders with the correct names and they must be located inside of the /res/pics/ folder.

The in-game downloaders will grab an image for face-down (Morph) cards on the battlefield.  To use a custom image, place a "morph.jpg" file in your res/pics/tokens directory.


Launching Forge and Memory Issues:

In the past, some people noticed java heap space errors and lengthy pauses. The memory requirements for Forge have increased over time. The default setting on your computer for the java heap space may not be enough to prevent the above problems.

The technically proficient can launch the forge jar with an argument from the CLI. The argument "-Xmx512m" may work for computers with 1 Gig of memory. Computers with 2 Gigs or more of memory should be able to use "-Xmx1024m" as an argument.

We have created several scripts that will launch the Forge jar with "-Xmx1024m" as an argument. People using Windows OS should double click the "forge.exe" file. People using one of the other *nix OS should double click the "forge.sh" file. People using Apple's Mac OS X should download the Mac version of Forge and then double click the "forge.app" application.

The script file must be located in the same folder as the Forge jar file and the Forge jar file name can not be changed. Otherwise, the scripts will not work.

If you have a low end machine you may find that the scripts above will prevent java heap space errors but will find that Forge still runs very slowly at times.

In this case you can try the following. Remove the background jpg picture from /res/images/ui/ folder. You can try using low quality pictures rather than the high quality pictures. Or you can try removing all of the jpg pictures from the pics folder.


Forge failed to launch:

If you're trying to run Forge for the first time, but it doesn't open up, you can try the following to get some output and help yourself/us solve the problem.

1) Open up a terminal
- Under Windows, press Windows+R, type "cmd", hit enter
- Under Linux, you probably know that yourself. Use your distribution's application menu, and search for "terminal" in a group like "utilities".
- Launch the program named "Console.app" which can be found in your /Applications/Utilities/ folder. Highlight the "All Messages" option and click on the "Clear Display" button before launching Forge.

2) Go to the folder where you unpacked Forge
- Windows: Let's say your forge is in D:\Programs\Forge.
- Type "D:", Enter to change to the D: drive.
- Type "cd \Programs\Forge", Enter to change to the directory.
- NOTE: On nonenglish systems, you might have problems due to the poor localization of Windows. Go to the innermost directory you find (worst case is "\"), then "dir", Enter to show all folders in that folder. Search for the one you're probably wanting. For Example the German "Programme" could really be "Program Files" or something like that.
- NOTE: You might have to "quote" directory names with Spaces in them
- Linux: Let's say your forge is in /home/user/Forge
- Type "cd /home/user/Forge", Enter
- NOTE: You might have to "quote" or 'quote' directory names with Spaces in them
- Current versions of Forge no longer include a launcher script for Mac OS, proceed to step three.

3) Run Forge
- On Windows, just type "forge.exe", Enter
- On Linux, just type "forge.sh", Enter
- Launch the Forge application bundle by double clicking on the program named "Forge.app".

Now you will probably see some sort of Error in the console. the first few lines contain a message that might help you. If you can't fix the problem yourself, please take the complete output and report your problem on the Forum.


The Card Pictures disappear when you restart Forge:

if you're running Windows 7, make sure you're running the program as an admin, otherwise no changes will be made to your system (nothing is saved). In Windows 7, Forge may be happier when run from somewhere in the My Documents structure, (they call them Libraries now???) or from another partition other than C:. The user has little permission to do much on the system drive.


Java Issues:

Some people that are using an early version of Java 7 under the Windows OS have reported errors that state "Split must have > 2 children". Anyone having this sort of problem should de-install java 7 and install java 6 instead.


Card Picture Issues:

The server which contained the high quality card pictures is now off line and these high quality card pictures are no longer available as a download from within the forge application. We apologize, but the current dev team do not maintain this server and this matter is out of our control.

Some people are choosing to re-download all of the low quality card and card set pictures when they install the next version of forge. This consumes large amounts of bandwidth needlessly. Please be careful!

When you install the new version of Forge, find the forge/res/pics/ folder. Either move it or copy and paste the pics folder over to the recently installed new version of forge. This way you will only have to download the pictures for the new cards.

This should save enough bandwidth that everyone will be able to download the new set pictures from the cardforge server. We do appreciate your efforts to save bandwidth. Thank you.
