Return enchanted creature card to the battlefield tapped under your control and attach CARDNAME to it. When CARDNAME leaves the battlefield, that creature's controller sacrifices it.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the upkeep of enchanted creature's controller, that player may pay 1 B. If he or she does, untap that creature.
