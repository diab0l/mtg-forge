Oracle:Target creature gets +3/+3 until end of turn. Exile Cyclical Evolution with three time counters on it.\nSuspend 3-{2}{G} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {2}{G} and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)
