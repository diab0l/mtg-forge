Oracle:Arc Blade deals 2 damage to target creature or player. Exile Arc Blade with three time counters on it.\nSuspend 3-{2}{R} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {2}{R} and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)
