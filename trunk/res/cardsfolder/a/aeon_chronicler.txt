Oracle:Aeon Chronicler's power and toughness are each equal to the number of cards in your hand.\nSuspend X-{X}{3}{U}. X can't be 0. (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {X}{3}{U} and exile it with X time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)\nWhenever a time counter is removed from Aeon Chronicler while it's exiled, draw a card.
