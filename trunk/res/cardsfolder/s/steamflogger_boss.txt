Text:Other Rigger creatures you control get +1/+0 and have haste.\r\n\r\nIf a Rigger you control would assemble a Contraption, it assembles two Contraptions instead.
#Ruling 5/1/2007 - Contraption is a new artifact type. There are currently no artifacts with this type. And there's no current game meaning of "assemble."
