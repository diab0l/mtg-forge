Text:(NOTE: This spell is rather buggy and should not be used at this time. When cast, it would cause a NPE. As a temporary fix, this card no longer has a drawback.)

# When Targeted can handle SpellAbilities along with Cards, this can be converted to the New SubAbilities
# May also need a check in TgtCardManaCost to convert from SA to Card
